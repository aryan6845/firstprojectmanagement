Description :-

This milestone focuses on creating and finalizing a detailed migration plan for the IT Infrastructure Upgrade project. The plan will outline all key activities required to upgrade our on-premise servers to a cloud-based solution. It will include:  
- A comprehensive timeline of migration activities.  
- Resource allocation (team assignments, tools, and budget).  
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies.  
- A contingency plan to handle potential downtimes or rollbacks.

The migration plan will be reviewed and approved by stakeholders, including IT team leads, department managers, and key decision-makers.  

Tasks :-

1. Assessment Report:  
   Document the current state of the infrastructure and identify components to be migrated.  

2. Cloud Vendor Evaluation:  
   Finalize the selection of a cloud service provider based on scalability, cost, and reliability.  

3. Task Breakdown and Resource Mapping:  
   Assign tasks to team members, ensuring clear accountability and scheduling.  

4. Risk and Contingency Plan:  
   Identify risks such as data loss, downtime, or compatibility issues and establish fallback options.

Significance :-

This milestone is critical because it sets the foundation for the entire project. Without a finalized migration plan :-  
    1. Lack of Clarity: Teams won’t know their responsibilities, which can lead to delays and miscommunication.  

    2. Increased Risks: Unforeseen challenges during the migration can result in significant downtime or data loss.  
    
    3. Stakeholder Approval: The finalized plan ensures all stakeholders are aligned, reducing conflicts during execution.

Achieving this milestone will ensure that the next phase—executing the migration—proceeds smoothly and efficiently with minimal disruptions to the organization’s operations. It reflects the collaboration and preparation necessary for a successful infrastructure upgrade.
